## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The **Persona AI Chat App** is a Next.js-based application that allows users to interact with an AI that takes on the personality, speaking style, and knowledge of a given persona.

You can define any persona (e.g., a teacher, celebrity, fictional character) by providing detailed background information, personality traits, and communication style. The app then uses this persona data to guide AI responses, ensuring the chatbot stays in character throughout the conversation.
